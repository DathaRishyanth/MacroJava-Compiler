Checklist for Assignment P1

1) Have you tarred + gzipped the file as XXXXXXXX.P1.tar.gz (your 8-digit roll number) or zipped it to XXXXXXXX.tgz? YES

2) Does your tar.gz / .tgz file expand (by using the command tar xvzf) to the base directory named XXXXXXXX (your 8-digit roll number), with sub directory named PY within it, and which in turns contains all your files? YES

3) Have you removed the a.out files and other generated files from your tar ball? YES

4) Does the above created P1 contains P1.y, P1.l, that can be compiled using bison -d P1.y; flex P1.l; gcc P1.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl -o P1? YES

5) Does your generated P1 take input from Standard Input (for usage of redirection) ? YES

6) Does your generated P1 write output to Standard Output (for usage of redirection) ? YES

7) Have you removed all the debugging messages that your program may output? YES

8) Is (some part of) the assignment plagiarized? NO

9) Any comments about your evaluation strategy :
        I'm assuming that this question asks about how my bison file will Parse the macrojava code and convert it into minijava.
        i.) Firstly the bison code checks the set of tokens with the macrojava grammar that is given.
        ii.) If it fails -> Failed to parse macrojava code.
        iii.) After parsing, as there are no macroexpressions and statements, We should expand every macrocalls into their
            bodies in the minijava code.
        iv) This is being done by storing the information of a macro in a struct and then using the info accordingly to expand.
